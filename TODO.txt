Box
-   check upload/download file instructions on Box
-   make sure file formats are descriped for
    ->  Flanking Sequence fasta files
    ->  compListPreviousPrimers
    ->  Sanger Outputfiles
    ->  ordered primers list 
-   describe folder file structure
-   add instructions on naming conventions for
    ->  flanking sequence fasta files
    ->  alleles/queries
    ->  primers
    ->  sanger sequences
    ->  sanger sequence primers

GFF file formats
-   note in attributes if sequence i sfrom sanger 


SGE
-   add function to look into sge files for errors
-   report if there are errors


Ordered primers
-   add list of primers that are ordered/tested/etc
-   look into adding attribute to primer object (is there a primer object?) indicating ordered/tested status
-   

B73 only search
-   make sure all steps complete ok for regular flanking sequences
-   implement B73 only steps for sanger sequences

General
-   check to make sure the correct files exist to do a step (current set up does not work)
-   look in folder for dbs and blast/filterfasta only against those
-   catch if user tries to do something prematurely
-   give user an option to go back if they don't see the files they want
-   implement lookup option for specific query or primer or sangerseq
-   fix file permissions issue somehow???

Blasting primers
-   check that primer is inside WT coordinates at least once
-   report if yes/no (may need to just clean up output)


TODO: do sanger stuff first!!!
Sanger sequences
-   check if sequences occur in two seqs data (naming convention changes)
-   put all data on one paper
-   look for sanger seqs that have no blast matches

lookup: ask for allele, get family, and vice cersa



Ask John:
-   notify when allele has no hits in a genome?
