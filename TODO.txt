-   move f(x)s converting queries to json to utils
-   look in folder for dbs and blast/filterfasta only against those

-   compare penalty values between generic and verification output
-   parse verification results and add to WorkingSet file
-   Query.py: replace __updateQueryPrimer3__ with __updateQueryPrimer3__ (ass in p3obj instead of dict)
