Digital Insertion Tool

This tool is designed to help users develop primers to isolate potential DsGFP insertion sites (also referred to as
flanking sequeces) in the maize genome. The focus of this tool is specifically on maize reference genomes A188v1, B73v5,
and W22v2, and focus on potential Ds insertion sites previously isolated by Dooner & Du. The primers are designed to
match primers that have already been developed specifically for the DsGFP element, GFP3UTR and 3-DsgG. Please contact
the author if you need assistance setting up the tool for a different reference genome, starting primers, or transposon.

The various parts of DIGIT are described in this document. They must be completed in order for a given set of flanking
sequences. For example, you will not be able to complete step 2, "Parse Blast results and find primers", until you have
completed step 1, "Blast a collecton of flanking sequences against maize genomes A188v1, B73v5, and W22v2".

========================================================================================================================

System requirements:

Python 3.6.8
bash
Sun Grid Engine

========================================================================================================================

SET UP

TODO: installing software as whole package

TODO: will I be abe to include reference dbs, both regular and blastable?
 -> if not, I have a script in SetupResources/ to make refs blastable

========================================================================================================================

Insertion Site Flanking Sequence Files

Upload a fasta-formatted file of the potential insertion site flanking sequences to be used into the directory
PutFlankingSequenceFilesHere/. Make sure the name of the file is representative of the contents and ends with the .fasta
or .fa file extension. The name of that fasta file will be used in creating the output of DIGIT so that data can be
correctly associated with that file as the program executes. For example,
FlankingSequences_SingleGenomicSequences.fasta will be associated with all data with the phrase
"FlankingSequences_SingleGenomicSequences" in the file or directory name.

========================================================================================================================

Genome Database

Maize genomes may be found at https://download.maizegdb.org/. Upload to the directory DIGITfiles/Genomes/<genomeName>
using the same SFTP method as before. This may take a while as these files are quite large. They will not be BLASTable
in the .fa file format. Call the script to make it BLASTable with the usage below:

    ./SetupResources/MakeReferenceGenomeBlastable.sh

========================================================================================================================

KMER lists

KMER mask lists may be found at https://primer3.ut.ee/lists.htm and will be uploaded as above to directory
DIGITfiles/Genomes/kmerLists with SFTP. Both zea_mays_16.list and zea_mays_11.list will be needed. These are necessary
to complete the Primer3 portions of the program.

========================================================================================================================

========================================================================================================================

STEP 1: BLAST FLANKING SEQUENCES

The first available option for using the DIGIT tool is to perform a BLAST search of the flanking sequences (in fasta
file format) against 3 reference maize genomes, A188v1, B73v5, and W22v2. This step must be completed in order to find
any further primer data. BLAST output arrives as a .tab file that will appear in the DIGITfiles/BlastOutput/<flankseq>/
directory, where <flankseq> is the name of the initial flanking sequence fasta file. There will be 3 output files in
this subdirectory, one for each of the maize genomes listed before.

Enter "1" when prompted to indicate you would like to use Blast. The contents of the PutFlankingSequencesFilesHere/
directory will be presented; you only need to enter the corresponding number to your selection. Because Blast is run
using the SGE queuing system on the CQLS cluster, it may take some time before the results are available. You can enter
"qstat" on the command line to check the status of your job.

========================================================================================================================

PART 2: PARSE BLAST OUTPUT, PRIMER3

This next part parses the blast output files, identifies the best match for each insertion site sequence, finds the
actual nucleotide sequence at that site, takes information on known primers for the DsGFP insertion, and crafts and
submits a Primer3 input file to create the necessary primers.

The best match is identified as the one that has the highest bit score. If there are multiple hits within a genome,
either the best or one randomly selected from the best is chosen. If the best bit scores match across genomes, then hits
are prioritized in the following order: B73, W22, A188.

Once the best match is identified, DIGIT takes the insertion coordinates (strand, base pair position) given by blast and
finds the nucleotide sequence around that insertion site from the genome database. The known DsGFP sequence is added to
create a predicted insertion sequence.

                                 insertion site
            3'-------------------^------------------^---------------5'
               genome sequence    DSGFP sequence     genome sequence

A Primer3 input file is made using these sequences, with the option to develop primers that match the GFP3UTR and 3DsgG
primers given for the insertion. Those two primers will match the DsGFP insertion site, and Primer3 will return in its
output primers that can be used with those in order to isolate the flanking sequence around the DsGFP insertion.

========================================================================================================================

PART 3: PARSE PRIMER3 OUTPUT, RUN PRIMER VERIFICATION

In this part, the Primer3 output from part 2 will be parsed and primers will be identified and named. Each insertion
sequence will have two primers, one to match each of the given DsGFP primers. DIGIT takes the new predicted primers and
submits them together to Primer3 with the wildtype flanking sequence (no insertion). This step helps verify that the
predicted primers will work on the insertion site regardless of whether the insertion is actually there.

========================================================================================================================

PART 4: VERIFY AND PRODUCE PRIMER DATASET

Part 4 looks for and notes any issues with verification. Next, it produces a primer dataset (DIGIToutput/<flankseq>/
DataSets/PrimerResults_<flankseq>.csv) for all primers and a failed primer dataset for failed primers and their
reciprical primers (DIGIToutput/<flankseq>/DataSets/FailedPrimers_<flankseq>.csv).

Part 4 will also Blast the primers against the three genomes so that it is possible to see how often that primer appears
in a genome .

TODO:
- parse those results of the Blast
- count and report number of instances
- note if there is an instance near the original insertion site
