Digital Insertion Tool (????)

System requirements:

Python3
Perl




what the fuck does this shit do???

1.  parses blast output

    a.  blast output is for a specific set of alleles from Dooner and Du where they say the Ds
        jumping gene likes to pop up
    b.  needs to have output corresponding specifically with those three genomes
            TODO: can I make it so genome dbs are not hardcoded in? rather its taken from what is
            available in the program?

2.  calculates the necessary coordinates needed for insertion prediction

    a.  what is sequence -2000 from insertion site? +2000 from insertion site?
    b.  note the overhang
    c.  -2000 to +2000 for wildtype -- used in validation

3.  compares insertions and picks the best one using bit score and relative knowledge of genome

4.  submits filterfasta requests to SGE






TODO: create venv with necessary modules? --> may not be worth the effort if run on CQLS

TODO: add blast to program?
